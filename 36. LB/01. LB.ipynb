    "Many of the fluid simulation methods use a discretization of a 3-dimensional partial differential equation representing motion in a continuum. However, other approaches, such as the Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) method,  considers fluids from a statistical mechanics point of view, treating them as a set of particles with probability distributions on their locations and velocities and simulating the evolution of these distributions."

As it does not deal with collisions, it can be done entirely separately for each of the discrete velocities, $e_i$.

The simplest type of boundary condition is simply the *bounce-back boundary condition*, that fluid incoming at a point hits a wall and bounces back. If the wall is at the edge of the fluid boundary, this is fairly simple. The fluid distribution with a velocity going away from the wall is determined not by some point beyond the wall (there is no fluid there!), but rather by the fluid coming into the wall with the opposite velocity.\n",
