    "\n",
    "Many systems of hyperbolic PDEs (such as the equations of hydrodynamics) can be written in the form of a system (linear or non-linear) of advection equations, so the study of this type of equation provides important information for more complex systems.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\partial_t \\psi + v \\partial_x \\psi = 0\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\psi(t,x)$ is a scalar function and $v$ is the constant speed with which the initial profile is advected (if $v > 0$ advection is from left to right). An example of this equation corresponds to the **Continuity Equation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above, the solution to this equation simply takes the initial profile, $\\psi(t=0,x)$, and moves it with speed $v$. The shape of the initial profile is preserved during advection.\n",
    "\n",
    "A direct substitution shows that $\\psi(x - vt)$ is a solution of the advection equation for any profile $\\psi$. This means that the solution is constant along the lines $x = v t$ (the curves along which the solution is constant are called **characteristic curves**).\n",
