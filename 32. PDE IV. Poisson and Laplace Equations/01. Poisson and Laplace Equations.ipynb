With this small modification it is possible to improve the calculation time and additionally less memory space is needed to store the intermediate calculations.\n",

    "where $\\omega$ is a relaxation parameter. The value $\\omega = 1$ retrieves the Gauss-Seidel method, values ​​$\\omega<1$ produce *sub-relaxation* (i.e. a portion of the previous solution is kept) and a value $\\omega >1$ produces *over-relaxation* (the new solution moves farther from the previous solution than in the Gauss-Seidel model).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most appropriate value for $\\omega$ depends on the particular problem being solved. However, values ​​in the range $1.2 \\leq \\omega \\leq 1.4$ usually give very good results. The SOR method requires fewer iterations than the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods and in general can be considered the most practical of all, although it is important to emphasize that the convergence of the solution also depends on the initial ansatz chosen."
